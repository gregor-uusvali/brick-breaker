# make-your-game-different-maps

## Objectives

The project is a Brick Breaker/Arkanoid game using only plain JS/DOM and HTML. In this game the player is tasked with clearing a formation of colorful blocks by deflecting a ball towards it without letting the ball leave the bottom edge of the playfield. Some blocks contain power-ups that have various effects, such as increasing the length of the paddle or increasing player lives. Other blocks may be indestructible or require multiple hits to break. The game runs at 60fps and you can pause and restart the game. A scoreboard displays the following metrics: timer, score, and lives.

## Controls

- Space - launch the ball
- ArrowLeft - move paddle left
- ArrowRight - move paddle right
- P - pause the game

## How to Run

`go run .`
